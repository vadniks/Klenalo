# Klenalo - realtime encrypted message & file exchanger and distributed file storage manager for local area networks

## Project is in early development stage

# `Due to the lack of enough free time, the development stalls periodically, the project isn't abandoned and won't be - it's gonna be finished eventually, just need to do other prioritized tasks(`

## No license yet - `TODO` - it's unstable unpolished draft now, the code will be changing significantly so there's no point in copying it yet - so don't copy/fork/use it yet ;)
Planned to be GNU GPL v3
